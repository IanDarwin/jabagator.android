= jabagator.android

A very crude drawing program, only on github becuase a few of its codes are
referred to in the printed edition of https://androidcookbook.com/[Android Cookbook]].

As it says in the project header, you *must* do the following before building:

. cd ..
. git clone https://github.com/IanDarwin/jabagator
. cd jabagator
. mvn install

Now you can try this:

. cd ../jabagator.android
. mvn package # or whatever
